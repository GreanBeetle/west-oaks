    <h3 class="subtitles">What does the Board do?</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="latoFont justified">
      The Board represents the owners and residents of the West Oaks Condos in all business dealings related to the running of the Community. The Board sets each year's budget, and approves expenditures for landscaping, utilities and maintenance for common areas, and business management services for the community. The Board also enforces the Conditions, Covenants and Restrictions (CC&Rs) that govern appearance and other characteristics of the West Oaks Condos community.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="latoFont justified">
      The Board meets regularly to conduct business. We encourage owners and residents to attend so they have a feel for how the community is run. The Board also hosts an annual meeting for the owners, at which important information is shared, and general decision-making and information is conducted.
    </p>
    <!-- <br>
    <p class="latoFont justified">
      The Board does not itself handle the day-to-day business of the community, such as billing owners for assessments, paying bills, liaising with landscapers and other contractors, and so on. For this, the Board has contracted with Sterling Management Group as our Community Management firm. For full details of what Sterling Management Group does and how to contact them, visit the <a href="/management">Management</a> page.
