    <br>
    <p class="latoFont">
      The WOC board has adopted a set of "house rules". These are interpretations and clarifications of the more formal governing documents, and also add some additional points intended to make living at West Oaks Condos even more enjoyable for all. (The provisions in the House Rules are just as enforceable as the more formal conditions.)

      These documents were filed with the State when West Oaks Condos were first proposed. In addition to describing the project, both documents set out the rules under which WOC runs. This document is equivalent to the "Conditions, Covenents, and Restrictions," i.e. CC&Rs, that govern planned communities.
